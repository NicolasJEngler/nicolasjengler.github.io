### Originally on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/nicolasjengler/post/how-you-can-contribute-to-web-standards)

Ever since since I started to work with the web, I always complained about some features, but the truth is I was angry for getting out of my comfort zone. To put it in a better way, yes, we have the right to scream and shout every time we see some cross-browser inconsistency, but in all reality we have the tools to change that.

Contributing to __Web Standards__ is easier (and more fun) than it seems! Getting inside a long mailing list with extremely technical discussions can be intimidating, but fear not, once you get the hang of it almost every topic is a piece of cake. Before we go deeper, take a closer look to this [__W3C__](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/) article: [_How to contribute to the W3C work? - Tutorials_](http://www.w3.org/blog/2007/06/contribute-w3c-tutorials/). You should also learn about the Working Groups, and you can do so by checking out [_this link_](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities). One of the most active/intense working group is the [_CSS Working Group_](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/).

When wanting to stay posted, here are some of the channels where you can keep up with web standards in its current state (hey, maybe help a bit if you can, the folks currently doing their job are working their asses off!):

- [Working Groups commits to public repositories](https://twitter.com/whatwg)
- [WHATWG - Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group](https://whatwg.org/)
- [CSS Working Group commits to public repositories](https://twitter.com/csscommits)
- [W3C mailing lists archive](https://lists.w3.org/)
- [W3C Public IRC](https://www.w3.org/wiki/IRC)
- [W3Conf's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/W3Conf)

You can also be reaaally helpful by using non-stable builds of each browser and report bugs to their respective forum or ticketing system:

- [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) - Chrome's non-stable builds
- [Chromium's issues list](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list) - Chromium is the open-source project from which Google Chrome is based on
- [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) - Mozilla's non-stable daily builds
- [Firefox's bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) - Bugzilla is a web-based bug tracker
- [Opera for Developers](http://www.opera.com/developer) - Opera's non-stable builds (updated every few times a week)
- [Opera's bug report wizard](https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/) - Proper place to report Opera's bugs
- [WebKit nightly builds](http://nightly.webkit.org/) - WebKit is a rendering engine that currently powers Chromium-based browsers and Apple's Safari
- [WebKit's bugzilla](https://bugs.webkit.org/) - Yup, WebKit is also using Bugzilla
- [Microsoft Edge & Internet Explorer bug report](https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=136) - Microsoft's own place to talk about Edge and IE issues

If you want to know how to correctly submit a ticket, [_Lea Verou_](http://lea.verou.me/) did a complete guide on how to properly report a bug. Check Lea's [_Smashing Magazine article_](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/help-the-community-report-browser-bugs/), it's totally worth it.
