Hey, I guess.

Let me start by telling you why I'm writing this.

For the last couple of months I've been lookin to start a front-end related blog, but it wasn't until a few days ago that I actively started to look for a lightweight, simple platform to use. I also wanted to upload it to GitHub in order to create a GitHub page and save myself the trouble of setting up a WordPress blog (or something like that) on my own server.

I fiddled a little with [**Middleman**](https://middlemanapp.com/) (using the [**middleman-blog**](https://rubygems.org/gems/middleman-blog/) gem), and also played a little with [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com/). They both are extremely easy to use, and incredibly powerful, but in the end I wasn't convinced. That's when I remembered about _CodePen's blogging platform_, and considering that I spent a fair amount of time in here, I couldn't think of a better place to write about front-end experiences.

I really hope this is the beginning of a long, loving relationship :)

Thanks again, CodePen.
