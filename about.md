My name is Nicol√°s Joel Engler, and I'm an argentinian digital product designer and sociology enthusiast.

This is a repository dedicated to posts and articles I've written in the past, spread throughout the web, either on sites like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/nicolasjengler/posts/) or as an invited author.
